	<p>If you're front-end is in need of some development, I'm here to help.</p>

	{% if site.available %}

		<p>I'm currently available for contract and freelance work. If you
		have a project in mind then please don't hestitate to
		<a href="mailto:mail@guyroutledge.co.uk">shoot me a message</a> and
		we can discuss the finer details.</p>

	{% else %}

		<p>I'm not currently available for new projects but if you'd like to
		<a href="mailto:mail@guyroutledge.co.uk">shoot me an email</a> I'm

	<p>My core offering is web, web-app and mobile development. I have an eye
	for good design but that doesn't make me a good designer. If you're looking
	for more of an all-rounder, I'm probably not your man. I do know some, however
	so drop me a line anyway and I'll see what we can do.</p>

	<p>Cheers.</p>
