A couple of days ago, I tried an experiment. It went well, although the
process still needs refinement.

## The Setup

I'm running [a WordPress
workshop](https://generalassemb.ly/education/wordpress-bootcamp-build-a-website-with-wordpress/london/6308)
with General Assembly at the end of the month. As part of that, I made
a fake site in static HTML and CSS called "WebChef".

The course will take people through the process of creating a custom
WordPress theme from the existing static site.

In order to know what concepts, methods and functionality I was going to
teach in the course, I decided to make the theme myself and approach
the project as if I was doing it for a client - with one small
difference.

## The Experiment

As this isn't a real client site, there was no restriction on talking
about it, showing people what it looks like before launch or blogging
about it before it was ready to see the light of day. 

I decided to build the whole theme whilst broadcasting my screen as
a Google Hangout - I've termed this "Coding in the Open" as rather than
seeing a polished final product, anyone who's interested can see the
whole process "warts and all".

The completed hangout gets [automatically uploaded to
YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gzFNjaeIy5Q) where you
can check it out if this kind of thing floats your boat...

## The Debrief

Everything went surprisingly smoothly! I shared the link to watch live
with some of my past students and a small handful even came along to
watch - I wasn't expecting anyone to do that!

Barring a few head scratching moments with the Hangouts interface,
everything was great. 

The only downside is that the video uploaded to YouTube was of a really
low quality and I hadn't upped the font-size of my Vim to a point where
it was readable; definitely two things to try and improve in the future. 

I also had my mic muted, partly because there was someone else working
in my office that day, partly because I wasn't sure what to say, and
partly down to fear of mumbling a lot of nonsense or expletives when
stuff didn't work as planned (this only happened once in a 2hr30min
video which was a pleasant surprise)!

Other than that, I enjoyed the process. I think a lot can be learned by
watching and sharing this kind of content; what tools people use, how
they approach debugging, what documentation they have to look up, how
they format their code and what order they approach things in are five
things that immediately come to mind - I'm sure there are others. 

## Next time?

I'll definitely try this again. I want to make a few tweaks and might
try and record a higher resolution video with ScreenFlow throughout the
session; we'll see. 

If this is something you like the idea of or would
like to be notified of the next attempt, drop me a tweet
