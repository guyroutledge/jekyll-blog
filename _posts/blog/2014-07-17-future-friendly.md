I feel sick. Well, I did earlier; things have calmed down a bit now.

I've made a decision. I've taken some action. I've decided to make a big
change in my life - a decision that is very much "Future Friendly".
This is something that's been bugging me for a while but I've been too
lazy to do anything about it. I've decided... to get fit.

Earlier this week, on Monday, I interviewed a nice chap called Sam. He's
a personal trainer and will be working with me twice a week to get me in
shape. We started this morning at 6am and it was a real shock to my
system!

I'm not particularly overweight (I am slightly), I don't eat
particularly badly (I do occasionally) but I'm seriously unfit. In
a series of strength and fitness tests we conducted in my garden this
morning, it turns out I have a long way to go - that's why I've bought
in the pros; if this kind of thing was easy, I would have got *myself*
in shape already but I've totally failed to do that so far.

It's going to be tough but I'm really looking forward to it. With the
light-headedness and sick-in-the-stomach feeling from this morning still
fresh in my mind, I'm also a little nervous about what the next 15 weeks
of training have in store. I knew that would be the case so I'm glad the
payment of Â£1200 has already left my account; there's no going back
now...

My goal is not just to get fit just for the sake of it but to get fit to
improve my long-term health, so I feel more awake, gain more mental
clarity and generally feel better about myself and increase my
confidence. It's going to be hard, but I'm really quite excited about
about the potential results.

Watch this space.
