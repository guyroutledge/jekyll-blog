Recently was made aware of this great little utility app for compressing images for the web: 

[http://imageoptim.com/](http://imageoptim.com/ ) 

Just check out the site, download and enjoy tiny images. In a quick test I got over 90% compression in the vast majority of PNGs as 24-bit PNGs are converted to 8-bit PNGs with alpha-transparency. There were also noticeable savings in both JPG and GIF formats.
