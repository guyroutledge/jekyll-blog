I used to work at an agency where projects would come and go with
various levels of briefing and organisation. I guess this is par for the
course when you work somewhere full-time but I was recently asked the
question: "what needs to be in place before you start?".

After I recovered from the shock of a project manager having the
foresight to ask such a question, I put a list together for them. But
I’m sure others could find it useful and I’ve no doubt missed a few
things, so here it is for anyone who might like to check it out.

## What needs to be in place before I start:

1. Remote git repo set up on your platform of choice with push access
   granted to me.
1. Staging environment set up with URL as discussed
1. New database created and named as discussed
1. Export of existing database as close to project start date as possible
1. All designs complete
1. All designs signed off by the client
1. Documentation from the designers detailing:
   * any animations 
   * transitions
   * interactions 
   * display of dynamic content (eg. AJAX)
   * hover states 
   * error messages
   * or anything else that can’t be communicated via a static mock-up of
   the design
1. Any necessary font licenses purchased or custom fonts made available as web fonts
1. A completed matrix of Information Architecture
1. A document containing all the copy

We’ll see if any of this materialises; fingers crossed.

In the meantime, if you think I have missed anything, drop me a tweet
[@guyroutledge](http://www.twitter.com/guyroutledge) and I’ll update the
list.
