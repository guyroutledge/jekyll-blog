I stumbled across [(yet another) side project][1] by [@Jack_Franklin][2] the other day and enjoyed reading through some Vim tips.

Yesterday I tweeted out a one liner of something I'd come across recently:

> `:x` to save changes to a file (if they exist) and exit - for when `:wq` is one key too many <a href="https://twitter.com/search/%23vim">#vim</a>

Jack suggested I contribute to TIL:Vim and to cut a long story, I wrote a quick post and you can check it out here: [TIL:Vim - Ways to Quit][3]

Thanks, Jack!
