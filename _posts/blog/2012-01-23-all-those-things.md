...that I always seem to forget can now be written down immortally as a reference. 

This resource will hold all the bits and pieces of "stuff" that I learn on my web travels. Hopefully I will find some of it useful at a later stage. If not, hopefully others might find some of it useful too. Quite frankly I learned almost all I know from playing around and reading other people's blogs, tutorials and snippets. If anything that I write here helps someone else, that's great; if it helps me remember that awesome thing I did way back when and wish I could remember now, that's great too. 

Happy geeking.
