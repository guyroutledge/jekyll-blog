I've bitten the bullet and gone freelance. Or contract. Or something,
I'm not entirely sure what people call it. One benefit of working for
yourself is charging more money. But with that comes invoicing and with
that comes a miriad of payment processes, hoops to jump through, forms
to fill in and waiting for cash to hit your account.

I was fortunate enough to score a couple of short term jobs, just after
making the move to contracting, and within days, I had a healthy looking
cashflow forecast for the following month. 

Unfortunately, that month rolled around, and no money arrived. My
book-keeping system automates late payment reminder emails but these
didn't seem to improve the situation.

Being diligent (and a big fan of money), I chased up on my absent cash
in person and on two occasions, was told that I needed to "fill in some
forms so payment could be authorised" and "sorry for not realising
sooner".

After completing and returning all the various paperwork, I had to
write-off my first handful of invoices and re-raise them. Fortunately,
I use [FreeAgent](http://www.freeagent.co.uk) to manage my books and
it's a very simple process and was entirely painless. The process of
having to wait another 30 days for payment, however, was not.

I've added an extra step to my negotiation process and it's to always
ask up-front: "what's your payment process".
