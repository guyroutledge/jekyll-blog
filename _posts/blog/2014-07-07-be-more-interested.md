I was catching up on listening to the Starting from Nothing podcast last
week and particularly enjoyed [an episode with Tai
Lopez](http://thefoundation.com/podcast/episode54/) in which he
gave some tips for becoming a more interesting person. The idea was
that you then become of more interest - perhaps more "value" - to
other people; even those "out of your league" be that in terms of your
social network, net worth, experience in your field, or even your looks.

This is an interesting point - I find interesting people "interesting"
so perhaps developing myself to make me more interesting would be effort
well spent? I could take up more diverse hobbies, read more books or even
just start blogging more, perhaps?

However, being "interesting" is just half the battle. I think becoming
more interest*ed* in other people has far more potential to lead to
stronger relationships, more opportunities and learn more about the
world.  Listening to what others have to say - really listening - and
taking a geninue interest will perhaps make you even more "interesting"
to them than reading 50 books or learning 5 new langauges. 

Of course, in order to genuinely take an interest in what others do and
say means you need to surround yourself with interesting people. If only
there were more of them around...
