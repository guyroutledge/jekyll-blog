I don't know about you, but I struggle with keeping up to date with
what's going on in the Wonderful World of Web. Further to that, I also
struggle with focusing on my projects, finishing  what I start, 
developing successful business ideas and explaining myself clearly (among
other things).

I also struggle with working on my own for extended periods of time with
no-one to bounce ideas off. This is a biggie and it can lead to moments
of madness and a fair amount of self-doubt.

I hoped I wasn't the only one who felt like this and decided to reach
out to a couple of friends. I kept the "madness" part quiet and floated
the idea of starting a small [mastermind
group](https://www.google.co.uk/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#q=define%20mastermind%20group).

I worried that being the least experienced of the three of us
(they've both published books and have thousands of Twitter followers) that
they'd say no or I'd feel like I wasn't bringing much to the table.

Fortunately, they both agreed!

We've been meeting weekly via Skype for the last month and discussing
our plans, goals, fears and struggles in detail. It's great to have such
a friendly and understanding environment to talk openly about ideas as
well as the financial and business side of them too.

We've all got projects on the go, mine being [AtoZ
CSS](http://www.atozcss.com), and we all have something different and
interesting to bring to the table. 

I'd heard about mastermind groups on various business podcasts but never
really knew how to get into one or where to start looking.  It turns out
the best approach is to start your own. I'd highly recommend it to
anyone!
