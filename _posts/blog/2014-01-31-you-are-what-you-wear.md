When I work from home, I don&rsquo;t have to dress to impress and
ocassionally I take a break from my office and sit on the sofa to hack
away on my projects. However, when meeting new clients or interviewing
for a new role, first impressions are important and how you dress and
present yourself are often the first things people notice.

Wearing my favourite t-shirt and jeans makes me feel my most
comfortable (and it _is_ important to be comfortable in interviews) but
that choice of outfit probably doesn&rsquo;t give a great first
impression. If the first impression is that I&rsquo;ve not made an
effort to present myself, how could that be interpreted?

Most creative agencies and startups have a casual dress-code but that
doesn&rsquo;t mean you can&rsquo;t wear something a little smarter for
that initial face-to-face. That&rsquo;s why today, I&rsquo;m wearing
a smart shirt, smart winter coat and shoes made of actual leather,
rather than the trainers (fraying at the seams) that I usually wear. 

When I work on a project, I give it my full care and attention and
always want to produce top quality work that I&rsquo;m proud of
- what&rsquo;s the point, otherwise? It can be hard to sell yourself in
words (it is for me at least) so if what I wear can help support my
values, so much the better.
