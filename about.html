	<p>The first website I made was back in 1997. It was a fan-site for
	the hit 90s TV show, <cite>Friends</cite>. It had a solid yellow
	background, was wrapped in
	<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1798817/why-is-the-center-tag-deprecated-in-html">center tags</a>
	and featured a prominent scrolling marquee. Donâ€™t judge me, it
	was a school project and I was 13.</p>

	<p>It gets a bit weirder, but bear with me...</p>

	<p>I went to the University of Edinburgh and studied Chemistry, Math,
	Archaeology, Architecture History and Classical Art. A logical selection
	if I ever heard one.</p>

	<p>Whilst at Uni, I taught myself film-making and cinematography and
	in 2005 I moved to London and worked as a cameraman for the next
	5 years. The money was crap but the work was great fun. I even have an <a
		href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2384162/"> IMDB page</a> but
	the only thing anyone's ever heard of is the 3 series of Derren
	Brown I worked on for Channel 4.</p>

	<p>Money from film work all but dried up so I got together with
	a friend of mine and exported prestige cars to the Far East. As you do.
	</p>

	<p>200 Audis, Aston Martins, Porsche and Japanese performance
	cars later, I was bored of that - and started looking for something
	else to sink my teeth into.</p>

	<p>I remembered that I enjoyed this "web design" thing so quit my
	job and took some time to get reacquainted with how that stuff worked
	in the modern day and age.  I read a lot of blogs, watched a lot of
	screencasts and studied hard in my home - which I was
	<a href="http://amasproperty.wordpress.com"> renovating with my
		partner</a> at the time.</p>

	<p>After a few months, I faked a CV and responded to a few unpaid
	internships advertising on Gumtree - a kind of a UK version of Craigslist.
	Within two days I had <b>three</b> offers for unpaid work.</p>

	<p>I figured I could probably get <em>some</em> money for my time
	so I turned them all down and put my CV on <a href="http://www.monster.co.uk">
	Monster.co.uk</a> instead. Within a week, I had agreed to take a paying job
	at a salary almost <em>3 times</em> what I used to earn</em>.</p>

	<p>I got lucky, but have found a real love for what I do. I now
	run my own business, Sapling Digital and am mostly working
	as a contract Front-end Developer in London, working on projects and with
	clients that I choose to work with and getting stuck into the London
	web community. I've also discovered the joy of teaching and have been
	working with <a href="http://www.generalassemb.ly">General Assembly</a>
	over the last 6-months, delivering a series of workshops and courses
	in my spare evenings and weekends.</p>

	<p>My joy of teaching has turned into my first real side project:
	<a href="http://www.atozcss.com">AtoZ CSS</a>
	a free video series all about the topic that got me hooked on this
	job in the first place.</p>
