		<h1>About Me</h1>
	</header>

	<p>I'm a self-taught web front-end developer and I have OCD (the good kind) and a love of Guinness.</p>

	<p>Further to that, I have a keen eye for design and I like building awesome, good looking, semantically marked up, progressively enhanced, standards compliant websites styled with a smattering of <a href="http://smacss.com/">SMACSS</a>. But you can read all about that kinda <a href="/projects">stuff that I do</a> elsewhere. As well as doing all those webby things, I occasionally keep myself occupied in other ways too.</p>

	<p>For instance, over the last few years I've spent most of my free time renovating properties in and around Kingston Upon Thames with my partner, Kylie. If you like that kind of thing, you can <a href="http://amasproperty.wordpress.com">read about my DIY antics</a> elsewhere. When not knee deep in rubble or crawling under floorboards, my passion is food and drink. I love experimenting in the kitchen and cooking on my epic 2m wide BBQ (when the weather is kind enough). I like to pretend that I know something about wine, but really, I just like a good drink or three with friends and family.</p>

	<p>My musical taste swings from classical to rock. I like fast, pretty cars with loud engines. I dive (but can't bring myself to face the British water temperature). I even enjoy a good book - usually non-fiction and often on the subject of business, property or self-development. I'm a serial podcast listener and love learning new things. I also enjoy reading blogs, watching screencasts, tweeting news and articles and when I'm not doing any of that, I'm sleeping. Or eating. Probably.</p>
